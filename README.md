PureChat is the main chat program built on top of PureChat-Framework.

To install PureChat please see the GitHub wiki pages on installation procedures. You can either download a zip package, or build from the sources. We recommend installing from a package in most cases, unless you're intersted in developing for PureChat, in which case you'll want to build from sources, as they include unit tests and documentation.

We also plan on having nightly build packages available on our website, if you want to have a bleeding edge version of PureChat. Nightly builds are considered stable in that there should be no code errors, however they may contain incomplete works or buggy features. Checking the bug tracker should yield further information on current problems.
